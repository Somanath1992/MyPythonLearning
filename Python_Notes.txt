1.Python is High Level General Purpose Programming Language
2.Python is Open Source Language
3.Python is platform independent Language
Downloading Python
-------------------------
https://www.python.org/downloads/ is official site to download Python
-The default installation path is 'C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311'
-Checking pyhton is installed using cmd just type 'pyhton' and hit enter

------Ways to Run Python Code-----
1.idle
-We can run python code through IDLE (Python Shell). Is the ide provided by python. 
2.CMD
-We can run python code using windows cmd.
-Open CMD type 'python' and hit enter
-Then write python code
-Usually idle and cmd works in same way. In both the ways we can not save python code or file.
3.Notepad /Notepad ++
-We can write a code in Notepad / Notepad ++ save that file as .py extension then we can run that file using CMD
-open cmd navigate to location where file is saved , write 'python filename' and hit enter
4.PyCharm
-Preferred
-Download from 'https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows' . Community edition free/open source
5.Eclipe (With PyDev plugin)

---Comments in Python------
-If we want to comment single line we can use # (Shortcut key ctr+/)
-For Multiline commnets we can use """ comment """ or ''' comment ''' 

---Python Keywords-----
-Reserved words which we should not used for defining variable or anything etc.
-To get list of keywords print(keyword.kwlist), will give list of keywords

----Variables---
1.Variable is nothing but a reserved memory location to store values
2.Variables are used to store data
3.Memory allocated when the values are stored in variables
4.Every variable must have some type

---Data Types----
1.Text type: str
2.Numeric types: int,float
3.Sequence types:list,tuple
4.Mapping type:dict
5.Set types: set
6.Boolean type: bool
-Pyhton is Dynamically Typed Programming Language means while defining a variable we don't need to specify its Data Type , python will automatically
assign type of data based on variable values
-We can change value of variable also in python where in java we can't

-----Operators-------
-A symbol which will perform an operation between two or more variables
-Types:
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Relational Operators
3.Logical Operators

----Taking Input From User----
-To take input from user we have input() function.
-By defualt it will always consider string as input.
-To convert integer data we need to convert string to integer using int method , for decimal numbers we need to use float.
-The conversion is called as Type Conversion

---Control Statements-----
1.Conditional Statements
a.if , b.if..else , c.elif
2.Looping Statements
a.while , b.for
3.Jumping Statements
a.break , b.continue


--range() function in pyhton--
1.range(10) -starting point 0 .... ending point 9 (n-1)
2.range(1,10) -starting point 1,...ending point 9
3.range(1,10,2) -starting point 1, ending point 10 , increment by 2
